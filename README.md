The following is a sample of products created during the "Data Visualization and Reproducible Research" course.

Project 01
In the project_01/ folder you can find an in-depth analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dynamics through data visualization techniques. This project focuses on exploring individual statistics, team performances, and match results to uncover patterns and trends within the IPL over the years.

Sample data visualization:

A bar plot showing the number of teams participating in the IPL over different seasons, indicating the league's growth and economic impact.

Project 02
In this project, I explored various aspects of the IPL data, including scoring patterns, city-wise match distributions, and model predictions of match outcomes. The project, located in the project_02/ folder, leverages machine learning models to predict match winners and offers insights into team performance dynamics.

Sample data visualization:

A pie chart illustrating the distribution of dismissal types for Virat Kohli, providing insights into his gameplay and areas for improvement.

Project 03
In this project, I explored IPL data further by analyzing match outcomes, batting and bowling performances, and player statistics. The project_03/ folder contains a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of IPL data, including match outcomes, dismissal patterns, and performance metrics of top players.

Sample data visualization:

A scatter plot visualizing the performance of top batsmen in terms of runs scored versus balls faced in various matches, offering insights into their batting strategies and effectiveness.

Moving Forward
Through these projects, I have gained a deeper understanding of data visualization techniques and their applications in analyzing complex datasets like those of the IPL. I plan to continue exploring data storytelling, focusing on how to present complex data insights in an accessible and engaging manner. Additionally, I aim to enhance my skills in reproducible research to ensure that my analyses can be easily replicated and built upon by others in the field.
