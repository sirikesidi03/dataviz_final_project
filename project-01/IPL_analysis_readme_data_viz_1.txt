DATA VISUALISATION MINI PROJECT-1
Decoding IPL Dynamics: A Data Visualization Exploration


motivation:

This project explores Kaggle’s Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset to find information on individual statistics, team performances, and match results. Considering the IPL’s status as one of the most popular cricket leagues globally, the purpose of this analysis is to identify patterns and trends that illustrate the league’s dynamics throughout time. These variables give insights on in-depth analysis of batsmen,bowler and team performance.


Data Description:

The data set includes match ID, season year, location, date, and important match facts, among other details related to IPL matches played in different seasons. Whether or not the Duckworth-Lewis technique is used because of weather delays, it provides information about the teams that are playing, the results of their matches, and the results of their tosses. Details on the venue, player of the match, victory margins, and umpire identities are given. While Duckworth-Lewis applications and victory margins are examples of numerical variables, most qualities are recorded as character data types. In-depth documentation is also kept of cricket-specific information such as innings, batting and bowling teams, overs, balls, runs scored, extra runs, and player dismissals.



Findings from plot:

The bar plot shows the number of teams participating in the IPL over different seasons. It reveals trends of expansion or stability in the league, indicating its growing popularity and economic impact.

The bar chart visualizes the number of wins by each winning team in each IPL season. Highlights the dominance of certain teams and performance trends over time, contributing to brand value and economic benefits.

The bar chart depicts the total number of matches played in each city. Identifies cities with significant match hosting, indicating economic and tourism impacts.

The pie chart illustrates the distribution of dismissal types for Virat Kohli in IPL matches. Provides insights into the most common dismissal modes, potentially highlighting areas for improvement in his game play.




Conclusion:

The graphs and chart offer an in-depth summary of the IPL’s history, team performances, and player statistics. They showcase the league’s expansion, the competitive scene, and individual player perspectives. This research not only improves our understanding of the IPL, but also provides important data for teams and players to strategize and improve. The project successfully employs data visualization methods to make the complicated statistics more accessible and educational, highlighting the league’s impact on the sport and economic significance.
